# Timeout Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis

Based on the logs, the lesson generation system was experiencing timeout issues:

1. **Grok Improved Route**: 180s timeout (3 minutes)
2. **AI SDK Route**: 120s timeout (2 minutes) ‚ùå **MISMATCH**
3. **Grok Original Route**: 300s timeout (5 minutes)

The AI SDK route was timing out at 2 minutes, but the Grok improved route needed up to 3 minutes, creating a race condition.

## Root Cause

The timeout mismatch caused the AI SDK to kill requests before Grok could complete:

```
‚ùå Grok improved failed: The operation was aborted due to timeout
üîÑ Trying original Grok implementation...
‚ùå Original Grok failed: The operation was aborted due to timeout
üîÑ Falling back to Gemini...
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Timeout Mismatch

**Before:**
```typescript
signal: AbortSignal.timeout(120000), // 2 minutes timeout
```

**After:**
```typescript
signal: AbortSignal.timeout(200000), // 3.3 minutes timeout (longer than Grok's 3min)
```

### 2. Timeout Hierarchy

Now properly aligned:
- **AI SDK Route**: 200s (3.3 minutes) ‚úÖ
- **Grok Improved Route**: 180s (3 minutes) ‚úÖ  
- **Grok Original Route**: 300s (5 minutes) ‚úÖ

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```
1. Tenta Grok improved ‚Üí Timeout 2min ‚ùå
2. Tenta Grok original ‚Üí Timeout 2min ‚ùå  
3. Tenta Gemini ‚Üí Funciona mas demorou 5min ‚úÖ
Total: ~5 minutos, 2 falhas
```

### After Fix:
```
1. Tenta Grok improved ‚Üí Funciona em 2-3min ‚úÖ
Total: 2-3 minutos, sem falhas
```

## Additional Improvements

### Image Search Resilience
- System continues without images if image search fails (502 errors)
- Graceful fallback to placeholders
- No impact on lesson generation success

### Error Handling
- Better timeout error messages
- Proper fallback chain: Grok Improved ‚Üí Grok Original ‚Üí Gemini
- Maintains user experience even with API issues

## Files Modified

1. **`app/api/aulas/generate-ai-sdk/route.ts`**
   - Increased timeout from 120s to 200s
   - Applied to all provider attempts (Grok improved, Grok original, Gemini)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with slow topics** that take 2-3 minutes to generate
2. **Monitor logs** for timeout errors
3. **Verify fallback chain** works when Grok is slow
4. **Check image search** continues working despite 502 errors

## Performance Impact

- **Positive**: Eliminates timeout failures
- **Neutral**: Slightly longer maximum wait time (3.3min vs 2min)
- **Positive**: Better success rate for Grok generation
- **Positive**: Reduced fallback to slower Gemini

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the fix
2. Monitor production logs for timeout errors
3. Consider further optimizations if needed
4. Add monitoring for image search API health
