## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Intent Detection Algorithm
```typescript
// Pattern-based detection with weighted scoring
const intentScores = {
  aula: 0,
  enem: 0,
  redacao: 0,
  general: 0
};

// Keyword weighting system
const educationalKeywords = {
  aula: [
    { word: 'aula', weight: 3 },
    { word: 'explicar', weight: 2 },
    // ... more keywords
  ],
  // ... other intents
};
```

### State Management
```typescript
interface ModalState {
  aula: { isOpen: boolean; topic: string };
  enem: boolean;
  redacao: boolean;
}
```

### Component Architecture
```

├── AulaModal
├── EnemSuggestion (in modal)
├── RedacaoSuggestion (in modal)
└── Intent Detection Integration
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### 1. **Aula Creation Flow**
```
User: "Quero uma aula sobre fotossíntese"
→ Intent detected: 'aula' with topic 'fotossíntese'
→ Smart suggestion appears: "Aula sobre fotossíntese"
→ User clicks suggestion
→ AulaModal opens with topic
→ User clicks "Criar Aula"
→ Progress indicator shows generation steps
→ Success state with "Ver Aula" button
```

### 2. **ENEM Simulator Flow**
```
User: "Preciso fazer um simulado ENEM"
→ Intent detected: 'enem'
→ Smart suggestion appears: "Simulador ENEM"
→ User clicks suggestion
→ ENEM modal opens with quick/full options
→ User selects "Simulado Completo"
→ Redirects to /enem?mode=full
```
