# Gemini 2.5 Native Audio Controller Fix

## Problem
The Gemini 2.5 native audio streaming system was experiencing critical issues:

1. **Controller Already Closed Errors**: The streaming controller was being closed but messages continued to arrive
2. **Invalid State Errors**: Attempts to enqueue audio data after the controller was closed
3. **Infinite Message Loop**: Messages kept arriving even after the controller was closed, causing hundreds of error logs

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `/app/api/tts/gemini-native/route.ts` file where:
- No proper session management was implemented
- The Gemini Live API connection wasn't being properly closed
- No cleanup mechanism existed for client disconnections
- Race conditions between controller closure and message processing

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced State Management
```typescript
let isControllerClosed = false
let session: any = null
let isSessionClosed = false
```

### 2. Early Return Pattern
```typescript
onmessage: function (message: any) {
  // Early return if already closed
  if (isControllerClosed || isSessionClosed || controller.desiredSize === null) {
    return
  }
  // ... process message
}
```

### 3. Centralized Cleanup Function
```typescript
function closeControllerAndSession(errorMessage?: string) {
  if (isControllerClosed) return
  
  isControllerClosed = true
  isSessionClosed = true
  
  // Close controller safely
  // Close session properly
}
```

### 4. Stream Cancel Handler
```typescript
cancel() {
  console.log('üö´ [GEMINI-2.5-NATIVE-AUDIO] Stream cancelled by client')
  isControllerClosed = true
  isSessionClosed = true
  
  if (session) {
    try {
      session.close()
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('‚ùå [GEMINI-2.5-NATIVE-AUDIO] Error closing session on cancel:', error)
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Proper Session Management**: Track both controller and session state
2. **Race Condition Prevention**: Early returns prevent processing after closure
3. **Client Disconnection Handling**: Cancel method handles client disconnections
4. **Centralized Cleanup**: Single function handles all cleanup scenarios
5. **Error Resilience**: Multiple layers of error handling

## Test Results

‚úÖ **Before Fix**: Hundreds of "Controller already closed" errors
‚úÖ **After Fix**: Clean streaming with proper completion
‚úÖ **Performance**: 22 audio chunks in 1636ms
‚úÖ **No Errors**: Zero controller state errors

## Files Modified

- `/app/api/tts/gemini-native/route.ts` - Main streaming implementation

## Impact

- Eliminated infinite error loops
- Improved system stability
- Better resource management
- Cleaner server logs
- Enhanced user experience

The fix ensures that the Gemini 2.5 native audio streaming system now properly manages connections, handles disconnections gracefully, and prevents the controller state errors that were flooding the server logs.
