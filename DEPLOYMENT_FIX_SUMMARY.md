# ENEM API Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The deployment was failing because the `render-start.sh` script was trying to start both HubEdu.ai and ENEM API in the same container, but according to the `render.yaml` configuration, these should be deployed as **separate services**.

## Root Cause

1. **Configuration Mismatch**: `render.yaml` defines two separate services:
   - `hubedu-main` (main Next.js app)
   - `hubedu-enem-api` (ENEM API)
   
   But `render-start.sh` was trying to start both in the same container.

2. **Port Conflicts**: The script tried to bind ENEM API to port 3001, but Render assigns a single external port per service.

3. **Missing Error Logging**: The startup script lacked detailed error logging to diagnose issues.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `scripts/render-start.sh`
- **Removed ENEM API startup logic** since it's deployed as a separate service
- **Added detailed environment variable logging** for debugging
- **Improved error handling** with better error messages
- **Added log file output** (`hubedu.log`) for troubleshooting

### 2. Updated `scripts/render-build.sh`
- **Removed ENEM API build steps** since it's built separately
- **Added informational message** about separate ENEM API deployment

### 3. Created `enem-api-main/start.sh`
- **New startup script** specifically for the ENEM API service
- **Environment variable logging** for debugging
- **Prisma client generation check** before startup
- **Detailed error logging** to `enem-api.log`
- **Process monitoring** to ensure API stays running

### 4. Updated `render.yaml`
- **Updated ENEM API start command** to use the new startup script
- **Maintained separate service configuration** as intended

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix ENEM API deployment: separate services with improved logging"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Render
1. **Main Service (`hubedu-main`)**:
   - Will automatically redeploy when you push to main
   - Uses the updated `render-start.sh` script
   - Only starts the main Next.js application

2. **ENEM API Service (`hubedu-enem-api`)**:
   - Will automatically redeploy when you push to main
   - Uses the new `start.sh` script
   - Runs independently on its assigned port

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment
1. **Check Render Dashboard** for both services
2. **Monitor logs** for any startup errors
3. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly

## Expected Behavior

### Main Service (`hubedu-main`)
- Starts Next.js application on Render's assigned port
- Logs environment variables for debugging
- Creates `hubedu.log` for troubleshooting
- Connects to main database (`hubedu-db`)

### ENEM API Service (`hubedu-enem-api`)
- Starts Next.js API server on Render's assigned port
- Generates Prisma client if needed
- Logs environment variables for debugging
- Creates `enem-api.log` for troubleshooting
- Connects to ENEM database (`hubedu-enem-db`)

## Environment Variables Required

### Main Service
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL` (from `hubedu-db`)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (auto-generated)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL=https://hubedu-main.onrender.com`
- `ENEM_API_URL=https://hubedu-enem-api.onrender.com`
- API keys (OpenAI, Google, GitHub)

### ENEM API Service
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=3001`
- `DATABASE_URL` (from `hubedu-enem-db`)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (auto-generated)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL=https://hubedu-enem-api.onrender.com`

## Troubleshooting

### If Main Service Fails
1. Check `hubedu.log` for detailed error messages
2. Verify environment variables in Render dashboard
3. Check database connectivity

### If ENEM API Service Fails
1. Check `enem-api.log` for detailed error messages
2. Verify Prisma client generation
3. Check ENEM database connectivity
4. Verify port configuration

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are set in Render dashboard
2. **Database Connection**: Verify database URLs are correct and accessible
3. **Port Conflicts**: Each service gets its own port from Render
4. **Prisma Issues**: Ensure Prisma client is generated during build

## Testing Locally

To test the fixes locally:

```bash
# Test main app startup
chmod +x scripts/render-start.sh
./scripts/render-start.sh

# Test ENEM API startup (in separate terminal)
cd enem-api-main
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the changes** following the instructions above
2. **Monitor both services** in Render dashboard
3. **Test API endpoints** once both services are running
4. **Update any hardcoded URLs** to use the Render service URLs
5. **Set up health checks** if needed for monitoring

## Summary

The main issue was a configuration mismatch between the deployment script and the Render service configuration. By separating the services properly and adding comprehensive logging, the deployment should now succeed. Each service will run independently with its own resources and database connection.
