# Fixes for "Aula não encontrada" Issue

## Problem Analysis

The issue where the Next.js application displays "aula não encontrada" (lesson not found) despite successful API calls was caused by several interconnected problems:

1. **Lesson data not being saved to database** - The `/api/aulas/skeleton` and `/api/aulas/initial-slides` endpoints were generating lesson data but not persisting it to the database
2. **JSON parsing error** - The `/api/aulas/next-slide` endpoint had a `SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input` on line 141
3. **Poor error handling** - Lesson retrieval endpoints didn't handle missing lessons gracefully
4. **Client-side issues** - No proper loading states or retry logic for lessons being generated
5. **Wikimedia API issues** - Invalid response structure handling

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Persistence Fixes

#### `/api/aulas/skeleton/route.js`
- ✅ Added Prisma database import
- ✅ Added lesson skeleton saving to database with `user_id: null` for demo lessons
- ✅ Added proper error handling for database operations
- ✅ Added logging for successful saves
- ✅ Return `lessonId` in response for client to use

#### `/api/aulas/initial-slides/route.js`
- ✅ Added Prisma database import
- ✅ Added `lessonId` parameter to request body
- ✅ Added lesson update logic to save initial slides to database
- ✅ Added proper error handling for database operations
- ✅ Return `lessonId` in response

#### `/api/aulas/next-slide/route.js`
- ✅ Added Prisma database import
- ✅ Added `lessonId` parameter to request body
- ✅ Added lesson update logic to save individual slides to database
- ✅ Added proper error handling for database operations

### 2. JSON Parsing Error Fix

#### `/api/aulas/next-slide/route.js`
- ✅ Added try-catch block around `await request.json()`
- ✅ Added proper error response for invalid JSON input
- ✅ Added detailed error logging

### 3. Lesson Retrieval Improvements

#### `/api/lessons/[id]/route.ts`
- ✅ Enhanced error messages with more details
- ✅ Added special handling for lessons being generated (starts with `lesson_`)
- ✅ Added `status: 'generating'` response for lessons in progress
- ✅ Improved logging for debugging

#### `/api/lessons/demo/[id]/route.ts`
- ✅ Added special handling for lessons being generated
- ✅ Added `status: 'generating'` response for lessons in progress
- ✅ Enhanced error messages

### 4. Client-Side Improvements

#### `/app/aulas/[id]/page.tsx`
- ✅ Added handling for `status: 'generating'` responses
- ✅ Added retry logic with 3-second delay for lessons being generated
- ✅ Added proper loading states for lessons in progress
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for different HTTP status codes

### 5. Wikimedia API Fixes

#### `/api/images/classify-source/route.ts`
- ✅ Added check for `batchcomplete === ''` response
- ✅ Enhanced error logging for invalid responses
- ✅ Added fallback handling for empty search results

#### `/api/wikimedia/search/route.ts`
- ✅ Added check for `batchcomplete === ''` response
- ✅ Enhanced error logging

#### `/lib/wikimedia-integration.ts`
- ✅ Added check for `batchcomplete === ''` response
- ✅ Enhanced error logging

## How the Fixes Work Together

1. **Lesson Generation Flow**:
   - Client calls `/api/aulas/skeleton` → Lesson skeleton saved to database with `lessonId`
   - Client calls `/api/aulas/initial-slides` with `lessonId` → Initial slides saved to database
   - Client calls `/api/aulas/next-slide` with `lessonId` → Individual slides saved to database

2. **Lesson Retrieval Flow**:
   - Client tries to load lesson → If not found and starts with `lesson_`, returns `status: 'generating'`
   - Client shows loading state and retries after 3 seconds
   - Once lesson is fully generated and saved, retrieval succeeds

3. **Error Handling**:
   - All endpoints now have proper error handling
   - JSON parsing errors are caught and handled gracefully
   - Database errors are logged but don't break the flow
   - Wikimedia API errors are handled with fallbacks

## Testing the Fixes

To test the fixes:

1. **Generate a new lesson**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/aulas/skeleton \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"topic": "Como funciona a digestão?", "schoolId": "N/A"}'
   ```

2. **Check if lesson is saved**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/lessons/demo/[lessonId]
   ```

3. **Test progressive loading**:
   - The lesson should now be found in the database
   - Client should show proper loading states
   - No more "aula não encontrada" errors

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

- ✅ Lessons are properly saved to database during generation
- ✅ No more JSON parsing errors in `/api/aulas/next-slide`
- ✅ Proper loading states for lessons being generated
- ✅ Retry logic for lessons in progress
- ✅ Better error messages and debugging information
- ✅ Wikimedia API errors handled gracefully
- ✅ No more "aula não encontrada" errors for properly generated lessons

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/aulas/skeleton/route.js` - Added database persistence
2. `app/api/aulas/initial-slides/route.js` - Added database persistence
3. `app/api/aulas/next-slide/route.js` - Fixed JSON parsing + added database persistence
4. `app/api/lessons/[id]/route.ts` - Enhanced error handling
5. `app/api/lessons/demo/[id]/route.ts` - Enhanced error handling
6. `app/aulas/[id]/page.tsx` - Added loading states and retry logic
7. `app/api/images/classify-source/route.ts` - Fixed Wikimedia API handling
8. `app/api/wikimedia/search/route.ts` - Fixed Wikimedia API handling
9. `lib/wikimedia-integration.ts` - Fixed Wikimedia API handling

The fixes address the root cause of the "aula não encontrada" issue by ensuring that lesson data is properly persisted to the database and that the client-side code handles the lesson generation process gracefully.
